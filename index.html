       <p>First referenced in 1901 by Julia Davis Chandler, the PBJ sandwich was an immediate hit with the youths and has remained a favorite since. Peanut butter was considered a bit of a delicacy back then and the PBJ made its first appearances in tea rooms and upscale settings. Eventually, with the commercialization of peanut butter, lower classes were able to afford the sticky substance. In the 1920s, sliced bread was invented which allowed children to make the sandwiches themselves without the need for a sharp knife and the rest, as they say, is history. The ease with which the sandwich could be constructed allowed it to become a major meal for children during the Great Depression.

The drive aims to fill 3 counties worth of food pantries with the lacking peanut butter and jelly. The Peanut Butter and Jelly Drive of Lockport celebrated its 9th year in 2018.
